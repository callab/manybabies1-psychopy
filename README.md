## A Psychopy implementation of ManyBabies1

This version is written to use the SMI REDn eyetracker, and relies on a [modified version of iohub](https://github.com/dyurovsky/iohub-callab). Until I get that code together and submit a pull request to psychopy, please replace the iohub folder with this modified one.
